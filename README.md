# 10-Day Challenge: Day 1 & Day 2 Highlights

## Overview

This repository contains my progress from the first two days of a personal coding challenge. It demonstrates basic interaction between frontend web development, Java, Node.js, and Electron.

## Day One: Follow-Me Dots

- Created an interactive HTML page with JavaScript.
- The page displays red and blue dots that follow the user's mouse movements dynamically.

## Day Two: Java Integration & Electron Window

- Developed a simple Java program that prints "Hello World".
- Executed the Java program using Node.js to demonstrate interoperability.
- Used Electron.js to run the Day One "Follow-Me Dots" webpage in a separate desktop window.
