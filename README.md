# 🚀 10-Day Coding Challenge: Day 1–3 Highlights

## 📖 Overview

This repository documents my personal 10-day coding challenge journey, covering a variety of concepts across frontend development, backend logic, and cross-language integrations. Each day adds a new layer of learning.

---

## 🟠 Day 1: Follow-Me Dots (Frontend Fun)

- Built an interactive HTML page using **vanilla JavaScript**.
- Implemented **red and blue dots** that dynamically follow the user's mouse movements.
- Practiced **DOM manipulation**, **CSS styling**, and **event-driven logic**.

📸 *Features Demonstrated:*
- Event listeners (`mousemove`)
- Real-time UI updates
- Visual effects using absolute positioning

---

## 🔵 Day 2: Java + Node.js + Electron

- Created a basic **Java program** that prints `"Hello World"`.
- Used Node.js to execute the Java program via `child_process`.
- Launched the HTML page from Day 1 inside an **Electron** desktop app window.

🛠 *Technologies Used:*
- `Java` (CLI)
- `Node.js` (`child_process`)
- `Electron` (desktop integration)

## 🟣 Day 3: Rule Engine (Modular Backend Logic)

- Designed and implemented a lightweight **Rule Engine** in Node.js.
- Defined **rules** and **actions** as separate objects, with rules referencing actions by name.
- Enabled dynamic business logic evaluation using modular, testable components.

🔁 *Example Rules Implemented:*
- Every user must be assigned to a department.
- Every department must have an associated quota.

⚙️ *Features:*
- Modular `rules` and `actions` mapping via string keys.
- Conditions determine whether an action should be executed.
- Clean separation of logic, useful for enterprise-grade configurations.

🧠 *Learning Focus:*
- Rule-based system design
- Abstraction of business logic
- Dynamic function mapping and evaluation

## ⚪ Day 4: Bouncing Balls & Tilting Board (Physics & Interaction)

**Goal:** Create an interactive physics simulation with bouncing balls on a tilting board.

**What I Built:**
- A board element that visually **tilts slightly** based on mouse movement (tilt along the Z-axis).
- Multiple balls that **bounce** realistically using velocity, gravity, and bounce factors.
- Balls respond dynamically to the board’s tilt direction, moving accordingly.
- Edge detection implemented **dynamically based on the parent container’s dimensions**.
